# a-star pathfinding algorithm

A pathfinding algorithm -- named A\*

- very popular
- efficient

## Used for my extended essay :)

It was quite confusing to implement but I got it done :)

- that is a lie tho
- wasn't that bad
- just coding problems :(

## Heuristics

very cool concept

- minimizes travelling to boring blocks
- various heuristics calcualtions can create unique movement patterns!

## Sample

I think I did something wrong, but here it is:

## Shoutout

To my own package I made for visual representation of algorithms! Since its actually so useful:
